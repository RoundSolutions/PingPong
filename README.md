# PingPong

The Round Solutions PingPong is an embedded IoT/M2M hardware platform made for Software Developers. The platform supports extension boards that add unlimited capabilities. It can be used to easily make physical devices that connect to the web. 

The RTOS version runs with the world's fastest 32-bit microcontrollers in C / C ++. The base board of PingPong has a high speed cellular module, a component for high-precision Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Internet, USB, CAN-Bus and many other components. The Quick Start Kit includes optional access to the cloud platform and related M2M Air simcard.

The PingPong Board has two extension connectors: One that provides power (3.3V/ 3.8V) and one communication bus connector. The communication buses are: UART, SPI, CAN and IÂ²C.  Just stack one or more of the following extension boards on top of the base board and the device is ready to use.
